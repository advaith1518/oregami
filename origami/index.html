        Lay out a rectangular piece of paper. If you are using patterned or printed paper, begin with the decorated side facing up so it will show on the outside of the boat
        Fold the sheet of paper in half from top to bottom to create a horizontal crease in the middle â€“ the non-patterned side of your paper should now be visible
        Fold the top corners in towards the middle so that they meet. Leave 1-2 inches of space at the bottom. You should now have a triangle shape
        Fold the flaps at the bottom of the triangle shape up on both sides
        Pop out the middle to make a hat shape
        Using your fingers, open the hat shape out even more until it forms a square. Tuck the corners of one flap under the other
        Fold up the bottom flaps of the square on both sides so you are left with a triangle shape
        Pull out the middle of the triangle to form a square
        Pull out the middle of the square
        Press the shape flat
        Open out from the bottom to assemble your boat shape
        Ta-da! You now have a paper boat which your kids can decorate however they like!

        Find a rectangular piece of paper. If you plan on flying your plane indoors, lightweight paper such as printer paper is perfect. Heavier paper such as origami paper or cardstock (thicker paper) is preferred if you plan to fly your plane outside, especially on a windy day.

        Fold the paper in half vertically. Crease and unfold. It is important to keep the creases sharp and surfaces smooth to decrease drag (resistance forces). [3]

        Fold the two top corners to the center crease. Do not unfold. At this point, your paper should form a "house" shape with a pointed roof and long straight sides.

        Fold the same corners again so the edges meet the center line. Do not unfold. Your "house" should look like a "tent" with a long, steep pointed roof and short straight sides. Fold your "tent" in half vertically to make the body of the airplane. Your

        Fold the top of the right and left sides down so they are aligned with the bottom of the body. At this point it is good to make sure your folds are symmetrical and your creases are sharp.

        Finish the wings by lifting the right and left sides up. The tops of the wings should form a flat, triangle-shaped surface. The body should be triangle-shaped as well and extend below the wings in the center of your plane.

        Enjoy your paper airplane. Once you've mastered the basic origami airplane, you can experiment with more advanced designs.
